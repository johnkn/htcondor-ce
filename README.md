[![Build and test HTCondor-CE RPMs](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/actions/workflows/build_and_test_rpms.yml/badge.svg?branch=V5-branch)](https://github.com/htcondor/htcondor-ce/actions/workflows/build_and_test_rpms.yml)

---

A site grid gatekeeper technology based solely on HTCondor components.

This package is simply a thin set of wrappers around HTCondor, allowing you to
run a HTCondor-CE without disrupting a site HTCondor install.

For example, `condor_ce_q` is the HTCondor-CE equivalent to `condor_q` for the
HTCondor-CE processes.  This package took much of its inspiration - and base 
code - from OSGs condor-cron package.

Sites are encouraged to install the sub-package `htcondor-ce-condor` or
`htcondor-ce-pbs`, depending on which batch manager they run.
